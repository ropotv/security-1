This is first laboratory work of Vasile Ropot, FAF-181 student.

Here I used password encryption in order to compare initial value to database value of the password. I didn't use a database, but in order to understand it better, I put some comments in Main Class.  

This is a Java Application.

Compiled application can be found in the folder: out/production/Security_1
